## PDF Thumbnails and PWA
This build includes a GitHub Action that generates first-page thumbnails for PDFs placed in `/ebooks/` and writes them to `/thumbnails/`. It also includes a `service-worker.js` and `manifest.json` to enable PWA install and offline caching.

To enable Giscus comments, set the `data-repo`, `data-repo-id`, and `data-category-id` values in the embed snippet in `/blogs/index.html` and your blog post templates.
